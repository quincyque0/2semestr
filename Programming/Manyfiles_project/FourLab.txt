A young man came to the Great Master. - Great Master, teach me Kung Fu. The Great Master was lazy. 
But he did not refuse the request, and said: - Of course, my son, I will teach you Kung Fu. But 
the spirits do not allow me to take students now. Come back in a year. The young man left. But a year 
later he returns. - Great Master, teach me Kung Fu. The Great Master became gloomy and said: - Yes, my son, 
I will teach you Kung Fu. But for this you must work on yourself. For 3 years, contemplate the rising of the 
sun every morning, and contemplate its setting every evening. Only then will you be able to comprehend the 
secrets of Kung Fu. The young man left. But after 3 years he returns. - Great Master! For three years, every
 morning I contemplated the sunrise and every evening the sunset. Teach me Kung Fu. The Great Master became 
 even gloomier and said: - Yes, now you can comprehend most of the secrets of Kung Fu. But before I teach you, 
 you must learn to hover 5 li above the ground yourself. The young man left. But after 5 years, he returned. 
 "Great Master, I have been training every day for 5 years, and now I can hover above the ground," the young man 
 said and hovered 5 li above the ground. "Holy shit," said the Great Master
